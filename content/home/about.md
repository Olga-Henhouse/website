# Biography

Hi, and welcome! I am an Economist writing my PhD Thesis at the Department of Economics at Tilburg University, the Netherlands, under supervision of Eric van Damme and Reyer Gerlagh. My research interests are Game Theory, in particular games of asymmetric information, and Environmental Economics. 

I participate in the Tilburg Behavioral Reading Group and the Tilburg Macro Study Group, as well as the Internal and External departmental seminar series at Tilburg University.
