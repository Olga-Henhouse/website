# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "	The present paper studies emissions abatement in a global game of technological investments. Players invest in competing technologies. One technology is cheap and dirty, the other expensive but green. Technological investments are strategic complements. While such games typically have multiple equilibria, uncertainty about the green technology's true potential leads to selection of a unique equilibrium. Without policy interventions, players may adopt the dirty technology even if payoffs are higher when all invest in the green technology instead. To remedy this inefficiency, I propose the concept of a network subsidy. A network subsidy virtually guarantees adoption of the green technology but does not, in equilibrium, have to be paid out. I also use the model to shed a new light on international environmental agreements."
