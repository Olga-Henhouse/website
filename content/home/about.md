# Biography

Welcome to my website! I am an applied microeconomic theorist interested in environmental economics and game theory, in particular global games. My supervisors are [Eric van Damme](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/eric-van-damme) and [Reyer Gerlagh](http://www.gerlagh.nl/).

I will be available for interviews at the 2020 / 2021 EJM and ASSA job market meetings! My job market paper can be found [here](https://www.roweno.nl/#jmp). For a copy of my C.V., click [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/O9FvdpTtkN1wBBR).

In my (non-existent) free time, I play the violin. Colleague [Sjak Smulders](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/sjak-smulders) and I from time to time force upon our fellow economists a [concert](https://twitter.com/TiUEconomics/status/1111204863382380544) in which we play music of our own choosing.
