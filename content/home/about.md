# Biography

Hi, and welcome! I am an Economist writing my PhD Thesis at the Department of Economics at Tilburg University, the Netherlands, under supervision of [Eric van Damme](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/webwijs/show/eric.vandamme_nl.htm) and [Reyer Gerlagh](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/webwijs/show/r.gerlagh_nl/).


My research interests are Game Theory, in particular games of asymmetric information, and Environmental Economics. 

I participate in the Tilburg Behavioral Reading Group and the Tilburg Macro Study Group, as well as the Internal and External departmental seminar series at Tilburg University.
