# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "	This paper studies emissions abatement in a global game of technological investments. Players invest in competing technologies. One technology is cheap and dirty, the other expensive but green. Technological investments are strategic complements. While such games typically have multiple equilibria, uncertainty about the green technology's true potential leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium, which may be inefficient. I specify sharp conditions under which the green technology is universally adopted. Implications for the design of domestic policies and international environmental agreements are discussed."
