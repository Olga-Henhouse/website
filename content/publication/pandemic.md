# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Newly emerging infectious diseases are expected to appear ever more frequently. Given the many uncertainties surrounding a new disease, we study global eradication efforts as a game of incomplete information. While models of disease eradication under perfect information tend to have multiple equilibria, we show that, for a world consisting of  N â‰¥ 2 countries, even a small amount of uncertainty leads to equilibrium uniqueness. Our equilibrium has several implications. First, pandemics can be rational. Second, a rational pandemic may be inefficient. Third, less harmful diseases may cause more deaths. Dynamically extending the game, a subset of countries commits to eradication whenever eradication is globally efficient. The equilibrium is again unique. Moreover, selection of the efficient no-pandemic equilibrium is greatly facilitated by this type of international cooperation."
