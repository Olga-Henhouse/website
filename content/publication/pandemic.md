# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We identify four key properties that characterize the outbreak of a new infectious disease in a globalized world: medical uncertainty, strategic uncertainty, strategic complementarity, and simultaneous policy responses. When jointly considered, these properties imply a global game. For a world consisting of N â‰¥ 2 countries, we prove uniqueness of equilibrium. This result relies crucially on the medical uncertainty, since games of complete information and strategic complementarities generically have multiple equilibria. We show that the unique equilibrium may be inefficient: countries may choose not to eradicate the disease when eradication would be efficient, fueling a rational pandemic. Furthermore, an intrinsically more lethal diseases might in equilibrium cause fewer deaths than a less lethal one. Only strong ex-ante cooperation can prevent these outcomes."
