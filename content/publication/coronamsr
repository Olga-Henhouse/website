# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We compare the decrease in energy demand and CO2 emissions in Europeduring the financial crisis 2008-2009 with the COVID-19 expected drop in demandand emissions, and the price response of the EU Emission Trading System (EUETS). We ask whether the rather limited current price reduction may be due tothe Market Stability Reserve (MSR), implemented in the EU ETS between thetwo crisis.  Stylized facts and basic theory are complemented with simulationsbased on a model of the EU ETS. Together, they suggest a mixed result.  TheMSR stabilizes the EU ETS price in turbulent times, but less than perfect.  Weshow that the more persistent the COVID-19 shock is, the less the MSR is ableto serve its purpose."
