# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Global games are a class of incomplete information games where players receive private noisy signals about some payoff-relevant fundamental of the game played. A broad literature studying global games has developed, including applications to such wide-ranging phenomena as currency attacks, banks runs, political riots, and debt crises. This paper extends the existing framework and introduces the class of sequential global games with strategic complementarities. We prove a sequential global game has at least one equilibrium in monotone strategies. Under the assumption that signals are sufficiently precise, the sequential global game has a unique equilibrium surviving iterated dominance, even if the complete information game has multiple equilibria. In terms of ex ante expected welfare, the equilibrium of a sequential global game compares favorably to that of a static global game. Several applications are discussed."
